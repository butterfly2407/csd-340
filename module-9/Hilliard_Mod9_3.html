        <h2>All About Me</h2>

        <p class="intro">I'm from a small town called Manning where everyone knows <span id="word1">_________</span>. I grew up with my mother and older sister. I lived in the same house until I left for college in 2016.</p>
        <p>I can remember going to the <span id="word2">_________</span> downtown with my family, playing games and getting on rides together. Those are some memories I'll hold dear to my heart forever.</p>
        <p>I have a three-year-old son, and we enjoy going to the park, traveling, and reading books. These <span id="word3">_________</span> keep us busy and incorporate learning time for the both of us.</p>
        <p>I currently work from home, and it's the reason I went back to school to pursue my <span id="word4">_________</span> in Software Development.</p>
