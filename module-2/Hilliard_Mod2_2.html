        <!-- Paragraphs -->
        <p class="intro">I'm from a small town called Manning where everyone knows eachother. I grew up with my mother and older sister. I lived in the same house until I left for college in 2016.</p>
        <p>I can remember going to the festivals downtown with my family playing games and getting on rides together. Those are some memories I'll hold dear to my heart forever.</p>
        <p>I have a three year old son and we enjoy going to the park, traveling, and reading books. These hobbies keep us busy and incorporate learning time for the both of us.</p>
        <p>I currently work from home and it's the reason I went back to school to pursue my career in Software Development.</p>
